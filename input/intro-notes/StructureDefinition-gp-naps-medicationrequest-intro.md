When exchanging concepts of sex or gender, refer to the guidance in the [Gender Harmony Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/xprod/ig/uv/gender-harmony/).

<p class="stu-note">This guide includes support for the extension Patient Sex Parameter For Clinical Use. This extension is published in this guide to pre-adopt the material published in the R5 <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/extensions/1.0.0">FHIR Extensions Pack</a>. This extension is an R4 (4.0.1) conversion of the canonical extension and contains forwards incompatible data types when converted to R4 (see the extension page in this guide for information on any  material differences). This content is under discussion with HL7 International and HL7 Australia and may be removed or changed during a later phase of an implementation project for GP NAPS.</p>
