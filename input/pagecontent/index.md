### How to Read this Guide

This guide is divided into several pages which are listed at the top of each page in the menu bar.

- [Home](index.html): This page provides the introduction and scope for this guide.
- [Guidance](guidance.html): This page provides guidance on using the profiles defined in this guide.
- [FHIR Artefacts](artifacts.html): These pages provide detailed descriptions and formal definitions for all the FHIR artefacts defined in this guide.
  - [Profiles and Extensions](profiles-and-extensions.html): This set of pages describes the profiles and extensions that are defined in this guide to represent Australian local concepts using FHIR. Each profile page includes a narrative description, guidance, and formal definition. Although the guidance typically focuses on the profiled elements and seeks to provide a ‘how-to’ guide when representing concepts, it may also may focus on un-profiled elements to aid with implementation.
- [Examples](examples.html): This page lists all the examples used in this guide.
- [Downloads](downloads.html): This page provides links to downloadable artefacts including the AU Base FHIR NPM package.


### Collaboration
This guide is the product of collaborative work undertaken with participants from:

* TBD

FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> connectathon events are key to the verification of the guide as being suitable for implementation. This implementation guide will be used as the basis for Australian connectathon events.
